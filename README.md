# Cilia Segmentation

The task is to design an algorithm that learns how to segment cilia. Cilia are microscopic
hairlike structures that protrude from literally every cell in your body. They beat
in regular, rhythmic patterns to perform myriad tasks, from moving nutrients in to moving
irritants out to amplifying cell-cell signaling pathways to generating calcium fluid
flow in early cell differentiation. Cilia, and their beating patterns, are increasingly being
implicated in a wide variety of syndromes that affected multiple organs.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
